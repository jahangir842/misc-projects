After installing and configuring Coolify, the next steps involve setting up your domain, configuring SSL certificates, and fine-tuning other settings to ensure your deployment is secure and optimized. Here’s a guide on what to do next:

## **Next Steps in Coolify: Setting Up Domain and Other Configurations**

### **1. Setting Up a Custom Domain**

Configuring a custom domain is essential for making your applications accessible via a human-readable URL.

#### **Step 1: Obtain a Domain Name**

- Purchase a domain from a domain registrar like Namecheap, GoDaddy, or Google Domains if you don’t already have one.

#### **Step 2: Update DNS Records**

1. **Access your Domain Registrar’s DNS Settings:**
   - Log in to your domain registrar’s dashboard and find the DNS management section.

2. **Create an A Record:**
   - **Name:** Use `@` for the root domain or specify a subdomain (e.g., `www` or `app`).
   - **Type:** A
   - **Value:** Your server’s public IP address.
   - **TTL:** Set to the default or lowest available (e.g., 300 seconds).

3. **Create a CNAME Record (Optional):**
   - **Name:** Use `www` or another subdomain.
   - **Type:** CNAME
   - **Value:** Your root domain (e.g., `panel.yourdomain.com`).
   - **TTL:** Set to the default or lowest available.

#### **Step 3: Configure the Domain in Coolify**

1. **Access Coolify:**
   - Log in to the Coolify interface at `http://your-server-ip:3000`.

2. **Add a New Domain:**
   - Navigate to the **Domains** section.
   - Click **Add Domain** and enter your custom domain (e.g., `panel.yourdomain.com`).

3. **Verify DNS Settings:**
   - Coolify will attempt to verify that the domain points to your server. Ensure DNS propagation has occurred (this may take a few minutes).

### **2. Configuring SSL/TLS for Your Domain**

Securing your domain with SSL/TLS is crucial for protecting your users and ensuring data integrity.

#### **Option 1: Let’s Encrypt via Coolify**

Coolify can automatically obtain and manage SSL certificates using Let’s Encrypt.

1. **Enable SSL in Coolify:**
   - After adding your domain, Coolify will prompt you to enable SSL.
   - Choose **Enable SSL** and Coolify will automatically request a certificate from Let’s Encrypt.

2. **Automatic Renewal:**
   - Coolify handles automatic renewal of SSL certificates, so you don’t need to worry about manual renewal.

#### **Option 2: Using an External SSL Certificate**

If you prefer to use an SSL certificate from another provider:

1. **Obtain SSL Certificate:**
   - Purchase or obtain an SSL certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

2. **Upload SSL Certificate to Coolify:**
   - Navigate to the **Domains** section in Coolify.
   - Select your domain and choose the option to upload an SSL certificate.
   - Provide the certificate files (CRT and private key) and configure them within Coolify.

### **3. Fine-Tuning Security Settings**

To ensure your Coolify deployment is secure, consider the following additional security measures:

#### **Step 1: Configure Security Groups (if using AWS)**

Ensure that your AWS security groups are correctly configured to allow only necessary traffic:

- **Allow traffic on ports 3000, 8000, and 6001** only from trusted IP addresses.
- **Restrict SSH access** to specific IPs or ranges.

#### **Step 2: Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**

For added security, enable 2FA on your Coolify admin account:

- Navigate to the **User Settings** section in Coolify.
- Enable 2FA and configure it with an authentication app like Google Authenticator.

#### **Step 3: Regular Backups**

Ensure that you have a backup strategy in place:

- **Database Backups:** Regularly back up any databases managed by Coolify.
- **Application Data:** Use Docker volumes or external backup solutions to safeguard your application data.

### **4. Deploying Additional Applications**

Now that your domain is set up and secured, you can start deploying additional applications.

#### **Step 1: Add a New Application**

1. **Connect to Your Git Repository:**
   - Coolify supports GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
   - Choose the repository containing the application you want to deploy.

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Set necessary environment variables, such as API keys, database URLs, or other configuration options.

3. **Deploy the Application:**
   - Choose the desired branch and deployment settings, then click **Deploy**.

#### **Step 2: Configure Load Balancing (Optional)**

If you’re deploying multiple instances of your application, you may want to configure a load balancer:

- **Internal Load Balancing:** Coolify can manage this automatically.
- **External Load Balancing:** If using a cloud provider like AWS, you can set up an external load balancer to distribute traffic.

### **5. Monitoring and Scaling Applications**

To ensure your applications are running smoothly, Coolify provides several monitoring and scaling options.

#### **Step 1: Monitor Application Health**

- **Dashboard:** Keep an eye on your applications via the Coolify dashboard.
- **Logs:** Access detailed logs for troubleshooting any issues that arise.

#### **Step 2: Scale Applications**

If your application needs more resources, you can scale it:

- **Vertical Scaling:** Increase the resources (CPU, RAM) available to a single instance.
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Deploy multiple instances of the application and distribute traffic between them.

### **6. Managing Coolify Settings**

Finally, you may want to explore additional Coolify settings to customize your deployment environment.

#### **Step 1: Configure Notifications**

Set up notifications to stay informed about the status of your applications:

- **Email Notifications:** Configure email notifications for deployment status, errors, and other events.
- **Webhooks:** Use webhooks to integrate Coolify with other services or tools you use.

#### **Step 2: Customize Application Settings**

- **Environment Variables:** Fine-tune environment variables for each application.
- **Persistent Storage:** Configure persistent storage for applications that require data to be stored between deployments.

#### **Step 3: Update Coolify**

Keep Coolify updated to ensure you have the latest features and security patches:

```bash
cd /opt/coolify
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will update Coolify to the latest version and restart the services.
